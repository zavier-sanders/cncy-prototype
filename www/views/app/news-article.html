	    				<p>Concurrency, Inc., a Microsoft-focused consulting firm, appears on this year’s Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. Concurrency ranked #1395, having achieved three-year revenue growth of 298%. The company was also ranked #12 on the top companies in Wisconsin list.
<blockquote>“Our growth continues to expand as IT leaders increasingly recognize the need to explore and adopt cloud-based solutions,” said James Savage, Concurrency founder and president. “We’re fortunate to be able to attract top talent in the region and have expanded our list of Microsoft MVPs to 8, all of whom have deep technical expertise and a commitment to knowledge sharing both internally and with our clients.”</blockquote>
<p>In describing this year’s Inc. 5000 list, Inc. Editor at Large, Leigh Buchanan, stated, “If entrepreneurship is an education, meet the best learners in class.” In fact, the companies on the Inc. 500 list didn’t just merely reflect the economy. They also contributed to it, having collectively created 57,822 jobs.</p>
<p>Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at <a href="www.inc.com/inc5000">www.inc.com/inc5000.</a></p>
